# Summary

This is a 3D printed robotic Arm. 
It follows the success of my previous smaller one <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1015238">EEZYbotARM</a> so I simply called it MK2  (make 2)

It is a little bigger and stronger, just to obtain an acceptable payload.

It has been designed without a definite purpose, the aim is educational, providing a suitable hardware that allow to concentrate on exploring all its potential applications.

It shares the kinematick linkage of the ABB IRB460 scaled down with a ratio of 1:7

I implemented also some little features like: a replaceable clamp with quick coupler, internal cable routing in main big arms, vertical axis supported by spheres. 
I'm also evaluating if it is necessary to add a counterweight or a balacing spring for the main arm.

SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE
As it has been already said on the previous issue, there are several ways to drive the arm. It depends on what kind of results you want to obtain. 
Mainly depends if you want to freely move it or make it repeat a loop.
I found easy using a Pololu Mini Maestro card that doesn't requires writing any code.
Anyway I made an  <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Android-APP-to-Control-a-3DPrinted-Robot/">Instructables: Android APP to control a 3DPrinted Robot</a> where you can find some code 

I'll made some updates in next days
HAPPY ROBOTING!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: PRUSAi3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0,3
Infill: 30%

Notes: 
It is a little more challenging to print than the MK1 due to its dimensions and also some parts geometry. 
It requires a printing area of about 200x200 mm and some pieces needs to be printed with supports enabled. Most people are scared by support (also me) but at the end its a tecnique that works and solve a lot of problems, so why not?

# Post-Printing

as for mk1 all holes are slightly tight because I prefer to adjust the size using an exact drill bit to recover any kind of possible misalignements
